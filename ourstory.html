     <p class="font-normal text-base text-left border-4 border-indigo-300 rounded-xl p-2">Since I was a child I remember my mother measuring out the almond flour as we'd make macarons of all colors for friends and family. I've carried this forward into my life frequently gifting boxes of homemade macaroons for birthdays and holidays often pairing them with different champagnes as an ode to the event being celebrated. From there bubbles and rainbows was born, bringing together two of my favorite things for everyone to enjoy!</p>
